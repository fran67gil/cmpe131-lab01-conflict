Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaboarte on a single project because everyone can add to it individually without messsing up anyone else's work or the main codebases. Members can add, change, or even fix bugs wihtout impacting the main branch. It can also help by preventing members to edit the same file and facilitate tracking peoples changes. They must be reviewed and tested by teams or other memebers to avoid errors.
